This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-adapt package of lpSolve, a
package for GNU R that provides functions for solving linear, integer
and mixed integer programs. lpSolve was written by Michel Berkelaar
and others and is maintained by Sam Buttrey.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>. The
sources were downloaded from CRAN at 
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'lpSolve' to
'r-cran-lpsolve' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for
R.

  Author: Michel Berkelaar and others
  Maintainer: Sam Buttrey <buttrey@nps.navy.mil>
  Description: Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
      solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this implementation
      we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R functions that solve
